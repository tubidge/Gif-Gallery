# Gif Gallery

* Gif Gallery is a simple site to demonstrate my understanding of API requests and creating dynamic HTML elements. 

## Instructions

* You can create new search buttons by entering text into the input box and clicking 'Add Button'. This will create a button using the exact text you enter.

* Once your new button has been created, give it a click to display 10 images relating to your button text.

* You can then click on each image to run the GIF animation.

* I have started you off with the most obvious GIF search term: Cats.
